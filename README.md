## Massively Multiplayer Casino Game:  
### The Best Blackjack, Tic Tac Toe, and Roulette Multiplayer Experience.

## Description:
In this Casino simulator we will generate a "board" of some game, for instance blackjack.
The game will be played between different players on separate computers. The server will send a copy of the game state to the clients, while keeping track of the players' turn and information.
The clients will send information back to the server (the player's decision in the game) and the server will again transmit data to another client.
